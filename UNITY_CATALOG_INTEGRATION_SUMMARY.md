# Unity Catalog Integration Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the work completed to integrate Unity Catalog (UC) master branch with Delta Lake Spark tests.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Build Configuration
- Modified `build.sbt` to create a `unityCatalogShaded` project
- Created `unityCatalogShaded/generate_uc_jars.py` script to:
  - Clone Unity Catalog from the `main` branch
  - Patch build.sbt to support Scala 2.12 (changed from Scala 2.13)
  - Update Spark version from 4.0.0 to 3.5.3 (for Scala 2.12 compatibility)
  - Update Delta version from 4.0.0 to 3.2.1 (for Scala 2.12 compatibility)
  - Compile Unity Catalog components:
    - `unitycatalog-server-shaded-assembly` JAR (123MB, includes all server dependencies)
    - `unitycatalog-spark_2.12` connector JAR (39KB)
    - `unitycatalog-client` JAR (321KB)
  - Copy JARs to `unityCatalogShaded/lib/`
- Configured Delta's build system to include these JARs in the test classpath

###2. Test Infrastructure
Created test utilities and test suite:

#### `UnityCatalogIntegrationTestUtils.scala`
- Embedded UC server management (`startUCServer`, `stopUCServer`)
- Database cleanup using reflection (to avoid Hibernate compile-time dependencies)
- SparkSession creation with UC and Delta Lake configuration
- UC catalog and schema creation using UC client API
- Port management for concurrent test execution

#### `UnityCatalogIntegrationSuite.scala`
- Test suite with 4 tests (ALL PASSING ‚úÖ):
  1. ‚úÖ **Unity Catalog connector availability** - PASSED
  2. ‚úÖ **Create and query Delta table in UC** - PASSED  
  3. ‚úÖ **UPDATE and DELETE operations** - PASSED
  4. ‚úÖ **Verify UC metadata for Delta table** - PASSED

### 3. Key Technical Solutions

#### Scala Version Compatibility
- Unity Catalog master uses Scala 2.13 and Spark 4.0.0
- Delta Lake uses Scala 2.12 and Spark 3.5.x
- **Solution**: Patched UC's build.sbt to cross-compile with Scala 2.12, using Spark 3.5.3 and Delta 3.2.1

#### Embedded Server Approach
- Initially considered external UC server approach
- **Final approach**: Embedded UC server within tests (inspired by UC's own test setup)
- Server starts before all tests, stops after all tests complete
- Uses random available ports to avoid conflicts

#### Dependency Management
- Used shaded server JAR to include all dependencies (especially Hibernate)
- Used reflection for Hibernate cleanup to avoid compile-time dependencies
- Proper API client configuration using `setHost()`, `setPort()`, `setScheme()` instead of `setBasePath()`

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ All Tests Passing!

All 4 integration tests are now passing successfully:

1. ‚úÖ **Unity Catalog server** starts successfully in embedded mode
2. ‚úÖ **UC API client** can create catalogs and schemas  
3. ‚úÖ **Spark connection** to Unity Catalog works correctly
4. ‚úÖ **Schema operations** (`SHOW SCHEMAS IN unity`) work
5. ‚úÖ **Delta table creation** in Unity Catalog using external tables
6. ‚úÖ **INSERT operations** into Unity Catalog tables
7. ‚úÖ **SELECT queries** from Unity Catalog tables  
8. ‚úÖ **UPDATE operations** on Unity Catalog tables
9. ‚úÖ **DELETE operations** on Unity Catalog tables
10. ‚úÖ **Metadata operations** (DESCRIBE TABLE EXTENDED)

### üîë Key Finding: External Tables Only

**Unity Catalog does NOT support managed tables.** All tables must be created as external tables with explicit `LOCATION` clauses:

```sql
-- ‚úÖ Correct: External table with LOCATION
CREATE TABLE unity.default.my_table (id INT, name STRING)
USING DELTA
LOCATION '/path/to/table'

-- ‚ùå Wrong: Managed table without LOCATION
CREATE TABLE unity.default.my_table (id INT, name STRING)
USING DELTA
-- Error: "Unity Catalog does not support managed table"
```

This is by design - Unity Catalog always requires explicit storage locations for tables.

## How to Run

### Generate Unity Catalog JARs
```bash
cd unityCatalogShaded
python3 generate_uc_jars.py  # or with --force to regenerate
```

### Run Tests
```bash
build/sbt "spark/testOnly *UnityCatalogIntegrationSuite"
```

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `unityCatalogShaded/generate_uc_jars.py` - JAR generation script
- `spark/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/delta/UnityCatalogIntegrationTestUtils.scala` - Test utilities
- `spark/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/delta/UnityCatalogIntegrationSuite.scala` - Test suite
- `UNITY_CATALOG_TEST_GUIDE.md` - User guide for running tests
- `UNITY_CATALOG_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Modified Files
- `build.sbt` - Added `unityCatalogShaded` project and dependencies

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **External Tables Required**: Unity Catalog only supports external tables with explicit `LOCATION` clauses
2. **Scala 2.12 Compatibility**: Required patching UC's build to support Scala 2.12 for Delta Lake compatibility
3. **Version Alignment**: Used Spark 3.5.3 and Delta 3.2.1 for Unity Catalog connector to match Delta Lake's requirements
4. **Embedded Server Pattern**: Following UC's own test patterns with embedded server provides reliable test infrastructure
5. **Shaded Dependencies**: Using shaded JARs is essential for proper dependency management (especially Hibernate)

## Conclusion

‚úÖ **Full Integration Complete!**

We've successfully:
- ‚úÖ Built Unity Catalog from master branch with Scala 2.12 compatibility
- ‚úÖ Created an embedded UC server for testing
- ‚úÖ Established UC connectivity in Delta Lake tests
- ‚úÖ **All Delta table operations working** (CREATE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- ‚úÖ Metadata operations working (DESCRIBE TABLE EXTENDED)
- ‚úÖ All 4 integration tests passing

The integration is now **fully functional**. The key was understanding that Unity Catalog requires external tables with explicit storage locations, which aligns with UC's design philosophy of separating compute from storage. This integration provides a solid foundation for testing Delta Lake with Unity Catalog master branch.
